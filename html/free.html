                    Santhiram Medical College & General Hospital provides free medical services, including an annual smile
                     program for cleft lip surgeries and free medical camps. While photos of specific free checks aren't 
                     readily available, you can find photos of the hospital, its facilities, and its community service 
                     initiatives on its official website and Justdial page. To find out about current free check-up initiatives, 
                     you should contact the hospital directly at the number listed on the Facebook page or their official website.
                     Health is the greatest wealth, and timely medical care can save lives. Many people in rural areas often neglect early symptoms due to lack of awareness or access to doctors. To bridge this gap, Shantiram Hospital is organizing this Free Mega Medical Camp, bringing together expert specialists under one roof. This camp is not just about treatment, but also about prevention, awareness, and guiding people towards a healthier life. Early detection of diseases like heart problems, cancer, gynecological disorders, bone and joint issues, eye conditions, and ENT problems can make a huge difference in treatment outcomes. By attending this camp, every individual has the opportunity to secure better health for themselves and their families, free of cost.

Good health is the foundation of a strong community. Many diseases can be prevented or treated successfully if detected early, but awareness and timely consultation are often missing in villages. With this vision, Shantiram Hospital is conducting a Free Mega Medical Camp to serve the people of Bangarupalyam Mandal and nearby Gram Panchayats. This initiative brings together expert doctors from different specialties, offering free check-ups, guidance, and treatment options. The goal is not only to cure illness but also to spread knowledge about healthy living, preventive care, and the importance of regular medical check-ups. Together, let us build a healthier, stronger future for every family.
