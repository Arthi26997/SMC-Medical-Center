                <h3>Ambulance Services</h3>
                <p class="text">Santhiram Hospitals provides ambulance services but doesn't appear to offer completely 
                    free ambulance transport as a general policy; instead, they provide free transportation for village 
                    adoptions and medical camps for specific communities, according to their Facebook post and their website
                    states they offer free transportation for surrounding villages for certain initiatives. 
                    For general inquiries about their ambulance services and any specific free provisions, it's best to
                     contact Santhiram Hospitals directly using the provided contact numbers, such as +91 9121022077 or 
                     +91 9121022078.

                    Details on Free Services
Village Adoption & Free Services: Santhiram Medical College & General Hospital has a program where they adopt villages in and around the Kurnool district. This initiative likely includes free transportation for the villagers to access medical services, but this is part of a broader community outreach rather than a standalone free ambulance. 
Free Medical Camps: The hospital organizes free mega medical camps in nearby areas, which may involve free transportation. 
NTR Vaidya Seva Scheme: The hospital also offers free treatment to eligible patients under the NTR Vaidya Seva scheme, providing free care for challenging illnesses. 
Where to Find Photos
Facebook Page: The official Santhiram Hospital Facebook page shares photos and updates on their community initiatives, including medical camps and other events. 
Justdial Photos Section: You can find various photos of the Santhiram Medical College & General Hospital and its facilities on its Justdial page. 
How to Get More Information 
Contact the Hospital: For precise details on free transportation services to surrounding villages or any free ambulance services, it is best to contact Santhiram Hospitals directly through the contact numbers provided on their website or social media.
It is possible that the query about a "free ambulance matter" arises from a misunderstanding of the free transportation services provided for medical camps, which is different from a general, unrestricted free ambulance service. Without more specific details about the alleged "matter," a definitive explanation is not possible
